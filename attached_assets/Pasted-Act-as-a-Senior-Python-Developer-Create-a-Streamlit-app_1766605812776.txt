Act as a Senior Python Developer. Create a Streamlit application integrated with Google Sheets to serve as an Active Recall Study Tool.

### Objective
The app allows the user to review study questions stored in a Google Sheet, type an answer, compare it with the correct answer using fuzzy string matching, and save the result back to the sheet.

### Data Structure (Google Sheets)
The Google Sheet has the following columns:
1. "Assunto" (Subject)
2. "Pergunta" (Question)
3. "Resposta" (Answer - Reference)
4. "Resultado" (Result - To be updated)
5. "Data" (Date - To be updated)

### Features & Logic
1. **Google Sheets Connection:**
   - Use `gspread` and `oauth2client`.
   - Load credentials from `st.secrets` (key: "gcp_service_account").
   - Load the worksheet data into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. **Quiz Interface (Streamlit):**
   - Use `st.session_state` to manage the current question index to avoid reloading the app randomly.
   - Display the "Assunto" and "Pergunta" of the current row.
   - Provide a text area (`st.text_area`) for the user to type their answer.

3. **Evaluation Logic:**
   - When the user clicks "Enviar Resposta":
     - Compare the user's input with the reference "Resposta" using the `thefuzz` library (token_sort_ratio).
     - Display the Similarity Score (0-100%).
     - Show the correct "Resposta" for comparison.
     - Provide two buttons for final decision: "Acertei" (Correct) or "Errei" (Incorrect). *Note: The user decides the final result based on the similarity score, as legal concepts require nuance.*

4. **Persistence:**
   - If "Acertei" or "Errei" is clicked:
     - Update the "Resultado" column in the Google Sheet for that specific row with the status.
     - Update the "Data" column with the current timestamp.
     - Automatically move to the next question.

### Dependencies
Create a `requirements.txt` with:
- streamlit
- pandas
- gspread
- oauth2client
- thefuzz

### Important Code Structure
- Ensure the app handles empty rows or end of list gracefully.
- Use distinct visual feedbacks (st.success for high similarity, st.warning for low).
- Do not hardcode credentials; rely strictly on `st.secrets`.
